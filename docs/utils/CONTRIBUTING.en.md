## Code Standards

### TypeScript Standards

- Write all code in TypeScript
- Provide complete type definitions
- Use interfaces to define API contracts
- Avoid using `any` type

### Code Style

- Use 2-space indentation
- Use single quotes
- No semicolons at line endings
- Use ES6+ syntax

### Testing Standards

- Each new feature should have corresponding tests
- Test coverage should be no less than 80%
- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Test cases should be clear and understandable

### Documentation Standards

- All public APIs should have JSDoc comments
- Update examples in README.md
- Add type definition documentation

## Utility Functions Specific Guidelines

### Browser Compatibility

- Ensure new functions work in all supported browsers
- Test feature detection across different browsers
- Verify the correctness of fallback solutions

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize for performance in frequently used functions
- Cache feature detection results when appropriate
- Minimize memory usage in event handling

### Error Handling

- Provide meaningful error messages
- Implement graceful fallback solutions
- Handle edge cases appropriately

## Release Process

### Version Management

Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** - Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** - Backward-compatible new features
- **PATCH** - Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Release Steps

1. Update version number:
   ```bash
   npm version patch|minor|major
   ```
